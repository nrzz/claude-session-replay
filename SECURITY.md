# Security policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes go into the latest release on `main`.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not report a vulnerability in a public issue. Use GitHub's private reporting: [https://github.com/nrzz/claude-session-replay/security/advisories/new](https://github.com/nrzz/claude-session-replay/security/advisories/new), or the contact in the [nrzz security policy](https://github.com/nrzz/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md). You can expect a first answer within 72 hours, and credit in the release notes if you want it.

## What this tool can and cannot protect

Exports are built to be safe to open: every piece of transcript text is escaped, the page has one script of its own and a strict Content-Security-Policy. An export holds whatever the session held unless you use `--redact`. Report an escaping bug privately.
